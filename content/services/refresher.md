If you haven't driven in a while, feel a bit rusty, or simply want to boost your confidence on the roads, refresher driving lessons are perfect for you. Whether you hold a G2 or a full G licence, I will help you brush up on your skills, re-familiarize you with current road rules and regulations, and tackle any specific areas where you feel less confident, such as downtown Toronto driving, parallel parking, or highway merges. We will work at your pace to ensure you feel completely comfortable and safe behind the wheel again.
