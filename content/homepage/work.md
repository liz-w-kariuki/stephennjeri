I was so nervous about my G1 exit test in Toronto, but this instructor made all the difference! The lessons were incredibly thorough, covering all the unique challenges of driving here. I felt completely prepared for the G2 road test, even navigating busy intersections and parallel parking in a tight spot. Passed on my first try! Highly recommend for anyone learning to drive in Toronto.
