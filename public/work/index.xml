      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting my full G licence felt impossible with Toronto&amp;rsquo;s highways, but thanks to the expert guidance, I nailed it! Stephen&amp;rsquo;s patience and detailed highway lessons were invaluable. I learned to confidently merge, change lanes, and handle high-speed traffic, which was a huge fear for me. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to ace your G test in Toronto, this is the instructor you need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was so nervous about my G2 test in Toronto, but Stephen made all the difference! The lessons were incredibly thorough, covering all the unique challenges of driving here. I felt completely prepared for the G2 road test, even navigating busy intersections and parallel parking in a tight spot. Passed on my first try! Highly recommend for anyone learning to drive in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sarah L&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
